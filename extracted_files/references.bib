abstract = {Low-voltage circuit operation is one of the primary requirements for the practical use of printed electronic devices employing organic thin-film transistors, in particular, the driving of devices with power supplied by energy harvesting using organic solar cells or biofuel cells, which require low-voltage operation, typically below 1 V. This study reports on printed organic inverter circuits that operate at 0.3 V with negligible hysteresis, a gain of greater than 10, and rail-to-rail input and output operation, by utilizing a blend of 2,7-dihexyl-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene and polystyrene. The ultralow voltage operation of these circuits can be attributed to its finely tunable turn-on voltage, low trap density, ohmic contacts, and minimal channel length modulation coefficients. Moreover, these organic inverter circuit arrays exhibit high uniformity with an average switching voltage of 0.32 ± 0.03 V. As a result, printed organic devices with ultralow operating voltages can be realized with exceptional reproducibility, helping to further the potential of printed electronic applications based on ultralow power organic devices in the future Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem.},

abstract = {Abstract p-Type and n-type organic thin film transistors (OTFTs) and complementary inverter circuits with finely patterned electrodes are fabricated by reverse offset printing. The electrodes achieve a channel length of less than 3 µm under optimized printing conditions. High-performance OTFTs are fabricated using these electrodes and printed p-type and n-type organic semiconductors, each achieving a mobility of 0.2 cm2 V−1 s−1 at a channel length of 50 µm. A complementary inverter circuit fabricated with a stacked OTFT structure is demonstrated using reverse offset printing. The inverter circuits successfully operate at a supply voltage as low as 2.5 V with a high signal gain of 14. These results are expected to contribute greatly to the development of integrated circuits with high-speed operation using OTFTs.},

abstract = {Printed and flexible metal-oxide transistor technology has recently demonstrated great promise due to its high performance and robust mechanical stability. Herein, fully printed inverter structures using electrolyte-gated oxide transistors on a flexible polyimide (PI) substrate are discussed in detail. Conductive graphene ink is printed as the passive structures and interconnects. The additive printed transistors on PI substrates show an Ion/Ioff ratio of 106 and show mobilities similar to the state-of-the-art printed transistors on rigid substrates. Printed meander structures of graphene are used as pull-up resistances in a transistor–resistor logic to create fully printed inverters. The printed and flexible inverters show a signal gain of 3.5 and a propagation delay of 30 ms. These printed inverters are able to withstand a tensile strain of 1.5\% following more than 200 cycles of mechanical bending. The stability of the electrical direct current (DC) properties has been observed over a period of 5 weeks. These oxide transistor-based fully printed inverters are relevant for digital printing methods which could be implemented into roll-to-roll processes.},

abstract = {Abstract Low-voltage operating organic electronic circuits with long-term stability characteristics are receiving increasing attention because of the growing demands for power efficient electronics in Internet of Things applications. To realize such circuits, inverters, the fundamental constituents of many circuits, with stable transfer characteristics should be designed to provide low-power consumption. Here, a rational inverter design, based on fully screen printed p-type organic electrochemical transistors with a channel size of 150 × 80 µm2, is explored for driving conditions with input voltage levels that differs of about 1 V. Further, three different inverter circuits are explored, including resistor ladders with resistor values ranging from tens of kΩ to a few MΩ. The performance of single inverters, 3-stage cascaded inverters and 3-stage ring oscillators are characterized with respect to output voltage levels, propagation delay, static power consumption, voltage gain, and operational frequency window. Depending on the application, the key performance parameters of the inverter can be optimized by the specific combination of the input voltage levels and the resistor ladder values. A few of the inverters are in fact fully functional up to 30 Hz, even when using input voltage levels as low as (0 V, 1 V).},

abstract = {Abstract Complementary metal–oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) inverters with low power consumption and high noise immunity are essential for realizing practical applications of printed logic gates and circuits. However, the performance of existing printed CMOS inverters is still unsatisfactory because p-type and n-type transistors do not match well. This work demonstrates novel low-voltage and high-performance CMOS inverters using partially printed thin-film transistors (TFTs) on 50 nm HfO2/Si substrates based on n-type indium zinc oxides (IZOs) and p-type chirality enriched (9,8) semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs). The high-k dielectric materials grown using atomic layer deposition and (9,8) SWCNTs with relatively large band gaps help to match the characteristics of p-type and n-type transistors—the IZO and SWCNT TFTs exhibit similar mobility on/off ratio, small hysteresis, and low sub-threshold swing at low operating voltages. The hybrid CMOS inverters demonstrate excellent performance with the highest voltage gain up to 45, the largest noise margin of 83\% at 1/2 Vdd, and the lowest static power consumption of 0.4 µW at Vdd of 2 V among recently reported printed CMOS inverters under relatively low annealing temperatures (300 °C). The strategies demonstrated here can be considered as general approaches to realize a new generation of high-performance printed logic gates and circuits.},
