The material stack of the EGFET device comprises an Indium tin oxide (ITO) signal routing layer, forming the drain and source electrodes. Additionally, it incorporates indium oxide $(In_2O_3)$ as a high-mobility inorganic n-type semiconductor. A composite solid polymer electrolyte (CSPE) serves as the insulating layer, capable of adapting to the rough semiconductor surface ~\cite{ref73}. The top-gate employs the conductive polymer poly (3,4ethylenedioxythiophene): poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS).

In an EGFET, the gate-electrode has the flexibility to be shifted away from the channel and isn't required to be positioned directly above the channel (as in an in-plane gate) as illustrated in Figure ∼\ref{fig14} Nevertheless, in an in-plane geometry, the gate-electrode area overlaid with the CSPE must be considerably larger than the channel area. This larger size is necessary to effectively drive a maximal quantity of electrons into the channel, thereby enhancing the gating mechanism ∼\cite{ref17}.
In this work, EGFET provides transistors with excellent figures of merit such as strong electric field with respect to conventional dielectric layers since the CSPE make a double Helmholtz layer mechanism which is explained in ∼\ref{Electrolyte-gating}.

\subsection {Laser Ablation}
\label{Substrate preparation}
 all layouts have been printed on a glass substrate of the area of $2*2 cm^2$ covered with sputtered ITO, can be structured by laser beam with the power of $5\%$. At the very beginning, the substrate to be designed through the k-layout software. and immediately after laser ablation the thickness of the ITO layer in the area of the electrodes can be measured using Dektak film height measurement tool about $100nm$ as indicated in

 \textit {Ultrasonic bath}

 Next, the substrate is cleaned with acetone
 and 2-propanol   1:1 in a ultrasonic cleaner, 
 
 functional materials.
 In this method, the substrate firstly merged into a becker filled with a ratio of 1:1 solution of acetone (C3H6O) and 2-Propanol (C3H8O). The temperature of the  ultrasonic cleaner set to be at room  temperature and the power=$10\%$ for $90 minutes$.
 
\textit{Plasma treatment}

An $O_2 $ based plasma cleaner was employed to introduce surface chemical activation functional groups by utilizing oxygen for subsequent surface decontamination. To achieve this, a power percentage of 10\% and a time duration of 15 seconds were specifically chosen.

\section{Functional materials}
\subsection{Ink formulation}
\textit{$In_2O_3$ Semiconducting channel }

To ensures the precise concentration of Indium (III) nitrate hydrate in the ink, facilitating accurate and controlled material deposition, the ink formulation has been calculated as follows:

The ink formulation consists of a $0.05$ M solution of  $In(NO_3)_2.H₂O$, specifically Indium(III) nitrate hydrate $In(NO_3)_2.H₂O$(Sigma Aldrich,$ 99.999\%$) with the molecular Weight of 300.83 g/mol, prepared in a water-based medium with a water-to- Glycerol, ACS, $99.5$\% $ratio of 4:1$.

Preparation:
$1.$	Firstly a balance has been leveled using a 5 mL glass vial.
$2.$	The required amount of In(NO₃)₂.H₂O took with the scoop spatula and weighted in a glass vial with the balance.
$3.$	$4 mL$ of  double de-ionized water taken using Pipette to dissolve the In(NO₃)₂.H₂O thoroughly.
$4.$$1 mL$ of Glycerol introduced to the solution again using Pipette.
$5.$	The final mixture stirred for 1 hr at room temperature, ensuring the ink remains transparent throughout the process.
Calculation of $In(NO_3)_2.H_2O weight: 5 mL\times0.05 mol/L=0.05 mmol In(NO_3)_2.H_2O$.
$0.025mmolIn(NO_3)_2.H_2O\times300.83 g/mol=0.075 g.$

\textit {Composite solide polymerlectrolyte (CSPE)}

Dissolving salts in a polar solvent to form electrolytes in a liquid phase is a common practice. Driven by the force equation $(F = q · E)$, an applied electrical field within this solvent effectively separates anions (negatively charged ions) from cations (positively charged ions). The solidification of the electrolyte occurs with the introduction of a polymer, making it a viable gating material for Thin-Film Transistor (TFT) structures. It's essential to ensure sufficient ion mobility when incorporating a polymer into the electrolyte.
Preparation:
Two different solution should be prepared seperately.

$1.$The CSPE,$ 4.29 $wt\% poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) is dissolved in $85.71 $wt\% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and stirred for two hours at $90 °C$.

$2.$Parallely, 1 wt\% lithium perchlorate $(LiClO_4)$ is dissolved in $9$ wt\% propylene carbonate
(PC) and stirred for two hours at RT.

$3.$ Finally, both solutions have be mixed and stirred together overnight until a homogeneous solution acquired.

\textit {Conductive top gate material PEDOT:PSS}

The compositions of the top-gate ink comprises of a precise blend of$ 70 $wt\% PEDOT:PSS and$ 30 $wt\% ethylene glycol $(CH_2OH)_2$. This formulation undergoes a meticulous two-hour stirring process, followed by filtration through a $0.45$ µm PVDF filter.
